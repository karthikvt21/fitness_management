This C code implements a  fitness  management system using linked lists, queues, and stacks. It allows users to check in, track workouts, check out, view current users, and view workout logs.

Data Structures-
Queue: Implements a queue of users waiting to check in
Stack: Implements a stack of users whose workouts are being tracked.

Functions-
createQueue(): Creates a new empty queue.
createStack(): Creates a new empty stack.
enqueue(): Adds a user to the end of the queue.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the user at the front of the queue.
push(): Pushes a user onto the top of the stack.
pop(): Removes and returns the user at the top of the stack.
addWorkout(): Adds a workout to a user's workout log.
printQueue(): Prints the list of users currently in the fitness center.
printWorkouts(): Prints the workout log for a given user.
Main Function

The main function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the system. It creates a queue for check-in and a stack for tracking workouts. It then enters a loop to handle user choices:

Check-in: Adds a new user to the check-in queue.
Track Workout: Removes a user from the check-in queue, pushes them to the workout stack, records their workout, and adds them back to the queue.
Check-out: Removes a user from the check-in queue.
View All Users: Prints the list of users currently in the fitness center.
View Workout Logs: Pops a user from the workout stack, prints their workout log, and pushes them back onto the stack.
Exit: Exits the program.
Limitations and Potential Improvements

The code lacks error handling for invalid user input.
The code could be improved by adding features like user authentication, workout history, and statistics.
Memory management could be enhanced by using dynamic memory allocation more efficiently.
The code could benefit from additional comments to improve readability.
Overall

This code provides a basic foundation for a fitness center management system. It demonstrates the use of linked lists, queues, and stacks to manage user data and workout information. It can be extended and improved to create a more robust and feature-rich application.
